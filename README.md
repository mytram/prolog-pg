# prolog-pg

My prolog playground.

I first got introduced to Prolog and Programming in Logic at Imperial
College. There were two Prolog lab exercises everyone student was
required to pass. At the time, I never learned the art properly. But
still I learned so much from the exercises in solving problems in so
different a paradigm. It has always remained fascinating to me
since. Almost 20 years later, in 2019, I decided to relive it and this
time, maybe master the art properly.
